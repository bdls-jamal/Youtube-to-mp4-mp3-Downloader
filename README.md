# Youtube-to-mp4-mp3-Downloader
A script for downloading youtube videos into mp4 or mp3 format. Downloads any youtube video quicker than online websites and without a 'middleman'.

# USAGE
Requires two packages to run: pytube and tkinter. These can be installed within a python IDE or through the command line. 
Enjoy!

# NOTES
Desktop application building is in progress to remove the need to have prerequisite packages and python installed. \n
Cleaner UI may or may not come but is a consideration.
